## Verified Models

Below is a list of tested models and third-party dependencies that are supported in the current version.

### Export from Source

We have verified that the Model Navigator export function works correctly for the following models. We're publishing
[scripts](../../tests/functional_framework) that run these exports.

| Source                                 | Model                                                                      |

### Optimize for Triton Inference Server

We have verified that the Model Navigator run command works correctly for the following models. We're publishing a subset of
[scripts](../../tests/functional) with [instructions](../tests/README.md#running-functional-tests) on testing.

Refer to the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) for any related issues on these models.
