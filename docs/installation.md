## Requirements
To use Model Navigator Export API you have to have PyTorch or TensorFlow2 already installed on your system.
To export models to TensorRT you have to have [NVIDIA TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) installed.

NGC Containers are the recommended environments for Model Navigator Export API, they have all required dependencies:
- [PyTorch](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch)
- [TensorFlow](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tensorflow)

The minimal required `Python` version for Triton Model Navigator is `3.8`.

## Export From Source

Triton Model Navigator Export API is installed with Model Navigator package.
To install Model Navigator Export API without Model Navigator dependencies use commands:

```shell
$ pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html git+https://github.com/triton-inference-server/model_navigator.git@v0.3.3#egg=model-navigator[<extras,>] --upgrade
```

Extras:
- pyt - Model Navigator Export API for PyTorch
- tf - Model Navigator Export API for TensorFlow2
- jax - Model Navigator Export API for JAX CPU
- jax_cuda - Model Navigator Export API for JAX GPU
- jax_tpu - Model Navigator Export API for JAX TPU
- cli - Model Navigator CLI
- huggingface - Model Navigator Export API for HuggingFace

## Optimize for Triton Inference Server

Triton Model Navigator Optimize step performs a search of optimal format and deployment configuration
of model or package produced by Export API on Triton Inference Server. The `optimize` command performs
a conversion to available formats, apply additional Triton backends optimizations and use `Triton Model Analyzer` for
profiling looking for best deployment configuration.

## Using Docker Container
The recommended way of using the optimize step is to build a Docker container with all necessary dependencies:
```shell
$ make docker
```

Running the Triton Model Navigator inside the container requires additional volumes mapping:
* `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` allows to communicate with host Docker Daemon to run additional containers required in some steps
* `-v <path-to-model-catalog>:<path-to-model-catalog>` the path to the catalog where your model is being stored
* `-v <path-to-workdir>:<path-to-workdir>` the path where Model Navigator commands are executed inside container

**Understanding volumes mounting and workspace**

The commands executed by the Triton Model Navigator creates workspace directory to store the artifacts and share them between the steps.
Additionally, some steps are run inside a separate Docker container maintained by the Triton Model Navigator.

In order to run the Triton Model Navigator inside the Docker container the commands must be executed from **mounted host path**.

Running the Triton Model Navigator container:
```shell
$ docker run -it --rm \
--gpus 1 \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-v <path-to-model-catalog>:<path-to-model-catalog> \
-v <path-to-workdir>:<path-to-workdir> \
-w <path-to-workdir> \
--net host \
--name model-navigator \
model-navigator /bin/bash

root@hostname:<path-to-workdir>#
```

Additional constraints when using `triton_launch_mode=docker`:
* The mappings of volumes inside the container **must match** the host path name, example: `-v <host-path-name>:<host-path-name>`
* Use `--ipc=host` mode running `model-navigator` container

## Installing from the Source

The Model Navigator can be installed from the source:
```shell
$ make install-with-cli
```
or using Pip:
```shell
pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com .[cli]
```
